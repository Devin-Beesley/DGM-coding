hats
dog 
who let the dogs out?
random barks
dragon roar from other case
mix of cats
sudden silence comes crashing in
not even the birds make a sound
goats brak the tension
D&D needed
a green dragon looms in the dim light of the dungeon what do you do?
heros ready weapons after filling armor
